# **Kickstarter Challenge**

## The Overview
####### The overview of this analysis explores a dataset interested in finding how different campaigns relate to the outcomes of launch dates and their funding goals. 

## The Purpose 
###### In this analysis, I am particularly intereted in finding the relation between outcomes, >'successful, failed, and canceled', based on the goal fundings in the subcateogory
of 'plays' and relating which cateogory was successful by their launch dates. 

## Challenges 
###### In analyzing this project, In the month of May based on the Outcomes by The Launch Dates, the parent cateogory >'theater' was the best month to successfully launch a play.
Comparing the Outcome by Goals, the best cateogory in theater to launch is a play. Looking at this data, this is a challenge because although theater is a successful cateogory, 
this graph proves in order to have a successful play, with hitting their funding goal, it must be in the subcateogory of >'plays'.
