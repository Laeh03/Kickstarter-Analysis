# Kickstarter Challenge
The overview of this analysis explores a dataset interested in finding how different campaigns relate to the outcome of launch dates and their funding goals.
The purpose of this analysis was to find the relation between outcomes; >'successful, failed, and canceled', based on the goal fundings in the subcateogory
of 'plays' and relating which cateogory was successful by their launch dates. 
As well as, showing trends and insights from various types of Kickstarters in order to help kickstart theatre campaigns.

## Challenges 

In analyzing this project, In the month of May based on the Outcomes by The Launch Dates, the parent cateogory 'theater' was the best month to successfully launch a play.
Comparing the Outcome by Goals, the best cateogory in theater to launch is a play. Looking at this data, this is a challenge because although theater is a successful cateogory, this graph proves in order to have a successful play with hitting their funding goal, it must be in the subcateogory of 'plays'. 


## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To more deeply understand the dataset, Cateogory Statisics and Subcateogory Statisics will be the first two features to look at in order to find the comparison of the 
Outcomes based on Launch date. we can use these two charts 'Cateogory Statisics' and 'Subcateogories Statisics' to understand the composition of 
'successful, canceled, and failed' plays overall by seeking out the Grand Totals.
 
### After compareing the two visuals, we may look at the Outcomes by Launch Date

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

We now can start to identify the funding goals of the successful plays fro this analysis. 
To get the true number of plays that were successful, we must use the '=COUNTIFS' formula and for the percentages, we must use the '=SUM' formula and round up.

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Looking at the visualization and dataset, we can see the funding goal of 1,000-4999 were successful by 70%,
The funding goal of 35000-39999, were successful by 70%, and funding goal of 40000-44999, was also successful by 70%. 
In conculsion of that, only 543 plays hit majority of their funding goals.

## Results

With the above data, we proved in order to have a successful play with hitting majority of their funding goals, it must be in the subcateogory of plays.
Although we did not hit 100% of the funding goals, we did accomplish majority with over half  from the percentages. 
In the Outcome based on Launch Dates dataset, to come close to funding goals it must be in the subcateogory of plays and to understand the 
composition, we must look at the Grand Totals. Looking into the dataset of Outcomes based on Goals, majoirty of our funding goals were accomplished, but only by 70% overall.

With both datasets Outcomes based on Goals and Outcomes based on the Launch Date, the limitations were filtering the cateogories, instead of an overal generalization.
In the earlier exploration, we can see that the limitations in this dataset are high funding goals not accomplished because of the Launch Dates.
