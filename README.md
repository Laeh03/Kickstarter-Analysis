# **Kickstarter Challenge**

## **The Overview**
####### The overview of this analysis explores a dataset interested in finding how different campaigns relate to the outcomes of launch dates and their funding goals. 

## **The Purpose**
###### In this analysis, I am particularly intereted in finding the relation between outcomes, >'successful, failed, and canceled', based on the goal fundings in the subcateogory
of 'plays' and relating which cateogory was successful by their launch dates. 

## **Challenges** 
###### In analyzing this project, In the month of May based on the Outcomes by The Launch Dates, the parent cateogory >'theater' was the best month to successfully launch a play.
Comparing the Outcome by Goals, the best cateogory in theater to launch is a play. Looking at this data, this is a challenge because although theater is a successful cateogory, 
this graph proves in order to have a successful play, with hitting their funding goal, it must be in the subcateogory of >'plays'.

## **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date**
###### To more deeply understand the dataset, Cateogory Statisics and Subcateogory Statisics will be the first two features to look at in order to find the comparison of the 
Outcomes based on Launch date. we can use these two charts >*'Cateogory Statisics'* and *'Subcateogories Statisics'* to understand the composition of 
>'successful, canceled, and failed' plays overall by seeking out the Grand Totals.

After compareing the two visuals, we may look at the Outcomes by Launch date

## **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals**
 In this part of the analysis, we now can start to identify the funding goals of the successful plays.
To get the true number of plays that were successful, we must use the >'=COUNTIFS' formula.
*>'=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx!F:F,"successful",Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx!D:D,">=1000",Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx!R:R,"plays")'*
Before moving on to our conculsion, we must identify the percentage using the >'=SUM' formula and round up. 
*>'=ROUND(B2/E2,1)'*

## **Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**
###### Looking into the Outcomes Based on Goals, the challenge i encountered was with the visualization. 

Looking at the visualization, and dataset, we can see the funding goal of 1,000-4999 were successful by 70%,
The funding goal of 35000-39999, were successful by 70%, and funding goal of 40000-44999, were also successful by 70%. In conculsion of that, only 543 plays 
hit majority of their funding goals. 
[Github Issues](https://github.com/Laeh03/Kickstarter-Analysis/issues/5)

## **Results**
With the above data, we proved in order to have a successful play with hitting *majority* of their funding goal, it must be in the subcateogory of plays.
Although we did not hit 100% of the funding goals, we did accomplish majority with over half of the percentages. 

In conclusion regarding the Outcomes based on Launch Dates, to come close to funding goals it must be in the subcateogory of plays and to understand the 
composition, we must look at the Grand Totals.
Looking into the dataset Outcomes based on Goals, majoirty of our funding goals were accomplished but only by 70% overall.

With both datasets Outcomes based on Goals and Outcomes based on the Launch Date, the limitations were filtering the cateogories, instead of an overal generalization.
In the earlier exploration, we can see that the limitations in this dataset are high funding goals not accomplished because of the Launch Dates.
